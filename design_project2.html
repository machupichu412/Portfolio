        <h2 class="designprojecth2">Problem Statement</h2>
        <div class="dp2">
            <p>LEGO Star Wars collectors want a way to track the 
                market value of different LEGO Star Wars items so 
                that they can make better financial decisions when purchasing LEGO.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="designprojecth2">Audience</h2>
        <div class="dp2">
            <p>LEGO Star Wars items are resold across many different platforms. 
                It is difficult for LEGO collectors to track the value of different items, especially after they have retired and do not sell for retail value anymore. LEGO is an expensive product to collect, so finding good deals can be crucial to saving money while also enjoying the hobby. This product is designed for passionate collectors of LEGO Star Wars items. This product’s target market is those who exchange LEGO Star Wars items, whether that be buyers, sellers, or both. While niche, creating a product for this market is valuable as there recently has been an emergence of LEGO Star Wars “investors”, who will purchase sealed products and resell them after they retire from retail stores. There is a lot of value in the LEGO Star Wars resale market, with retired and in-demand sets possibly having resale values of thousands of dollars. It could be potentially viable to offer a subscription-based model to access more detailed market data, as serious collectors would find value in this information. 
            </p>        
        </div>
        <h2 class="designprojecth2">Design Process</h2>
        <div class="dp2">
            <p>Starting the design, I knew that I wanted the item listings
                to be the main feature of the product. These listings would display price information of LEGO Star Wars products. I started off by making a rough draft
                of the item listing pages in Figma. The listings include an image of the item, the current market price, and a graph of 
                the item's resale history. 
            </p>
            <div class="rough">
                <img src="assets/dp2/Rough Draft.png">
            </div>
            <p>
                Prototyping the functionality of the product probably took the longest time to complete.
                I learned to use Figma components in order to streamline the design process and easily 
                use the same element across different pages, such as the bottom navigation bar. This saved me a lot of time
                as I did not have to recreate basic functionality across each new page.
            </p>
            <div class="rough">
                <img src="assets/dp2/Prototyping.png">
            </div>
            <p>
                For the user interface design, I wanted to pay homage to the 
                LEGO Star Wars video games, mainly LEGO Star Wars The Complete Saga and The Skywalker Saga, as they are very popular in the LEGO Star Wars
                community.
            </p>
            <div class="ui_inspo">
                <img src="assets/dp2/tcs menu.png">
                <img src="assets/dp2/tss menu.webp">
            </div>
            <p>
                I think the design inspiration is very obvious in the prototype itself.
                The logo is composed of the LEGO Star Wars The Complete Saga logo and
                uses the same font. In addition, the login menu and many more pages use the
                menu font from TCS. The Skywalker Saga inspiration is visible in the "hologram"
                style that is prevalent throughout the app, which is reminiscent of the Skywalker Saga pause menu. 
                Holograms are very essential to the Star Wars aesthetic, so I think it ties the overall
                visual theme of the app together nicely.
            </p>

        <h2 class="designprojecth2">User Feedback</h2>
        <div class="dp2">
            <p>Feedback during the design process suggested that there was some confusion with the functionality
                of the app, especially when first signing up. To address this, I developed a 
                short tutorial that guides new users through the app.
            </p>
            <div class="rough">
                <img src="assets/dp2/Onboarding.png">
            </div>
            <p>
                The tutorial covers most of the features of the app, which hopefully improves the onboarding experience.
                I would like to perform more user testing with this tutorial in order to gauge its efficacy.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="designprojecth2">Solution</h2>
        <div class="dp2">
            <p>My product answers the problem statement by providing a resource for LEGO Star Wars collectors
                to find market data in order to make more informed financial decisions when deciding what, when, and where
                to purchase LEGO Star Wars items. This product would theoretically have every LEGO Star Wars item ever released
                and their corresponding price information available to view. Each listing for these items shows its current value
                based on items currently for sale online. Current for sale listings from across the web for each item are
                aggregated and put in one place, so that users of the app can find good deals on an item they want. 
                In addition, the historical price information would be available in the form of
                a line chart, allowing users to see trends in the price and potentially predict future trends. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The product also includes a "collection" feature that allows users to estimate 
                the total value of their collection by adding items to a list. I felt this would be a useful
                feature because as a LEGO Star Wars collector myself, I know it is a tedious task to attempt to find the price of every single item in my collection.

        <div class="dp2">
            Going forward, I hope to develop this prototype into a functional
            mobile or web application. I would like to utilize the Bricklink (LEGO resale marketplace),
            eBay, and Mercari APIs in order to actually track current and previous market data 
            for every LEGO Star Wars item.

        <h2 class="designprojecth2">Retrospective</h2>
        <div class="dp2">
            This design project was a huge learning experience for me.
            I learned a lot about the design process and the importance of user feedback.
            My knowledge of Figma definitely increased from the project, and I am
            now more proficient in the use of components to create designs.
